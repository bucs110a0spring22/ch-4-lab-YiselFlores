## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?:
changed window to wn
Summary of function(s) added:
graphtime(myturtle):
 "Function gives you the date in which the graph was drawn"
 birthday_count(current_date):
  "Function gives you the months and days passed since the date of the graph drwan and user's bday"
Summary of Feature Added:
 ^^ see above

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
 None

## REFERENCES:
 Turtle time library

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
 Honeslty looked through python library to minimize my line of code but it tripped me up considering that lab 4 had a turtle as parameter and have to use that in all functions. Like you can plot axis with other methods and not turtle, and was alot harder to minimize my code that way *for me*.
